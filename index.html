   <h1>Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw</h1>

<p>After eight films that have amassed almost $5 billion worldwide, the Fast & Furious franchise now<br>
features its first stand-alone vehicle as Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham reprise their roles as
<br>Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw in Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw.</p>

<p>Ever since hulking lawman Hobbs (Johnson), a loyal agent of America's Diplomatic Security
  <br> Service, and lawless outcast Shaw (Statham), a former British military elite operative, first faced off
  <br> in 2015’s Furious 7, the duo have swapped smack talk and body blows as they’ve tried to take each other down.</p>

<p>But when cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton (Idris Elba) gains control of an insidious bio
   <br>-threat that could alter humanity forever — and bests a brilliant and fearless  rogue MI6 agent (The Crown’s
   <br>Vanessa Kirby), who just happens to be Shaw’s sister — these two sworn enemies will have to partner up to bring down<br>
    the only guy who might be badder than themselves.</p>

<p>Hobbs & Shaw blasts open a new door in the Fast universe as it hurtles action across the globe, from Los Angeles to London<br>
and from the toxic wasteland of Chernobyl to the lush beauty of Samoa.</p>

<p>Directed by David Leitch (Deadpool 2) from a script by longtime Fast & Furious narrative architect Chris Morgan, <br>
the film is produced by Morgan, Johnson, Statham and Hiram Garcia. <br>
The executive producers are Dany Garcia, Kelly McCormick, Steven Chasman, Ethan Smith and Ainsley Davies.</p>
